      "There is no one right way to design a level in Super Mario Maker. However, there are plenty of Tips and Tricks every would-be level designer should take into consideration - whether it’s your first time building a simple course, or you’re planning on making the most challenging stage possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doors vs. Pipes: Knowing when to use a door or a pipe is key to designing a good level. Doors can take you anywhere in the current level (You can have up to 4 sets of doors on a level). Pipes, on the other hand will take you to a sub-level (once you’ve unlocked sub-levels, that is). Place them wisely to send players all over the map, and use up empty space that would normally be out of reach. To create a pipe connection, just drag Mario into a pipe and then place the exit. To create a door, place the twin doors and then move one to a different location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less is More: There is a finite amount of things you can place in a level. So don’t go nuts and be smart about what pieces you use where and when. But you can get more mileage by using pipes to connect to a sub-level. The sub-level can have its own theme (though you can’t switch to a different game version) and its own set of blocks and enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testers Wanted: Never doubt the power of a little play-testing. Before uploading your creation online, consider letting friends or family try it out. You’ll often be amazed at how someone else interprets a level, and does things in ways you may least suspect. Having others try out your level is also a good way to find something worth tweaking you may have overlooked. Once online be sure to check out comments to see what others think!\n",
      "\n",
      "Checkpoints and Rewards: Take care when your level gets overly long. Long levels (especially difficult ones) tend to get frustrating unless you start rewarding the player with things like Power-Ups if you don’t add checkpoints. Remember to leave powerups after difficult or drawn out areas of your level.\n",
      "\n",

Think about constructing the skeleton of a stage first, and then going back to add enemies, traps, and other obstacles. Restrain yourself. More enemies don’t make a better level. Blind jumps are never fun for players, so make sure your level communicates that dangers lie ahead. You can, for example, mark a path with coins or arrows to remove the guess work. And I’ve seen a level with a blind jump with coins, but they lead right into spikes! Don’t do that!\n",

Physical copies of the booklet could also be obtained by contacting Nintendo by telephone and requesting a physical copy of the book after verifying that you in fact did purchase a digital copy of the game via the Nintendo Network ID (NNID).However, there are a few codes worth pointing out that aren’t actually gameplay footage. By entering the code 0913, you can watch a video of Koji Kondo (Super Mario Bros. musical composer) playing a medley of music from Super Mario Bros. on an electric piano. By entering the code 1309, you can watch a video in which both Tezuka and Miyamoto sign their autographs on large white cards.
